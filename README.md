This example is used by the Polymer Dart code lab, which walks you through using the polymer.dart package. It has been modified from the original. Changes are comprised of a set of Item classes which abstract out the some repetitive code involved in creating the Codelab UI. 

The original code lab lives at: http://dartlang.org/codelabs/polymer/
